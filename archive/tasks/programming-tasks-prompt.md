I provided you with a jupyter notebook (experiment_programming_v1.ipynb) containing different python programming exercises. You are tasked to solve all given tasks from the notebook as it is described in the notebook. Keep in mind that you are editing the source code of the ipynb file. If you want to add code to a cell remember this syntax: 
  {
   "cell_type": "code",
   "execution_count": null,
   "metadata": {},
   "outputs": [],
   "source": [
    "time_started = 'HH:MM'\n",
    "print('Time started:', time_started)"
   ]
  },
