# 🐍 Python Programming Challenge
____

## 🧪 Experiment for my Master's Thesis research

This repository contains a set of Python programming exercises. Your task is to solve as many challenges as you can.
Please solve the challenges with Python programming language.


## 🚀 Getting started
1. Run the select_exercises.py file to generate 10 random exercises for you to solve. 
    - console command: `cd experiment` -> `python select_exercises.py` or open the `select_exercises.py` file and press the `Run` button in your IDE.
    - this will generate 10 folders within the `Exercise` folder with the exercises you need to solve.
2. Solve the exercises in the generated folders.
    - The folder contains an instruction.md file with the exercise description and a Python file with the exercise template.
3. Test your implementation by calling the function.

## 🧾 Important notes:
- You can use any Python standard library module if not specified otherwise in the exercise description.
- Don't use any external library (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, etc.) unless the exercise description specifies otherwise.
- Don't change the function signature (name, arguments) in the template file as it will break the automated tests.
- You are allowed to use any resources available to you (e.g., books, internet, ChatGPT, ...).



## 📁 Zip your Exercise folder
After you have solved the exercises, please zip your `Exercise` folder. You will be asked to submit this zip file in the survey.
