# 🐍 Python Programming Challenge
____

## 🧪 Experiment for my Master's Thesis research

This repository contains a set of Python programming exercises. Your task is to solve all given exercises.
Please solve the challenges with Python programming language.

## 📦 Clone Repository
- Clone this repository to your local machine using VS Code `CTRL + SHIFT + P` type `Git: Clone` and paste the GitHub URL `https://github.com/lucahlg/PyCodingExperiment.git` 
- **Alternative 1**: Use the following command in your terminal to clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone
    ```
- **Alternative 2**: Download the repository as a zip file and extract it to your local machine.

## 🚀 Getting started
1. **Run the select_exercises.py** file to generate 5 random exercises for you to solve. 
    - **Tipp:** navigate to the folder with `cd PyCodingExperiment` and execute `python select_exercises.py` or open the `select_exercises.py` file and press the `Run` button in your IDE.
    - this will generate the `Exercise` folder with 5 subfolders containing the exercises you need to solve.
2. Solve the exercises in the generated folders.
    - The folder contains an instruction.md file with the exercise description and a Python file with the exercise template.
3. Test your implementation by calling the function.

## 🧾 Important notes:
- You can use any Python standard library module if not specified otherwise in the exercise description.
- Don't use any external library (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, etc.) unless the exercise description specifies otherwise.
- Don't change the function signature (name, arguments) in the template file as it will break the evaluation with automated tests.
- You are allowed to use any resources available to you (e.g., books, internet, ChatGPT, ...).


## 📁 Zip your Exercise folder
After you have solved the exercises, please zip your `Exercise` folder. You can use the `zip.py` script or use Windows/Mac built in tools to zip the folder. You will be asked to submit this zip file in the survey.
